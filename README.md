# Why?

This guy managed to leak his own Jar in a very unique way. He a dumbo. Also configs don't work so yeah.

# How To Use
1. Download the Fabric installer [from here](https://maven.fabricmc.net/net/fabricmc/fabric-installer/1.0.1/fabric-installer-1.0.1.jar), open it and choose Minecraft 1.21 & Fabric Loader 0.15.X
2. Download chainlibs-1.0.jar (Virgins Client) from this repository page along with Fabric API and put them all into your .minecraft/mods folder
3. Start the game (with Fabric)
